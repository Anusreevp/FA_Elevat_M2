            We’d like to offer the React community an option to adopt individual new features as soon as their design is
            close to final, before they’re released in a stable version—similar to how Meta has long used bleeding-edge
            versions of React internally. We are introducing a new officially supported Canary release channel. It lets
            curated setups like frameworks decouple adoption of individual React features from the React release
            schedule.

            tl;dr
        </h3>
        <div class="container">
        <ul>
            <li>We’re introducing an officially supported Canary release channel for React. Since it’s officially
                supported, if any regressions land,
                we’ll treat them with a similar urgency to bugs in stable releases.</li>
            <li>Canaries let you start using individual new React features before they land in the semver-stable
                releases.</li>
            <li>Unlike the Experimental channel, React Canaries only include features that we reasonably believe to be
                ready for adoption. We encourage frameworks to consider bundling pinned Canary React releases.</li>
            <li>We will announce breaking changes and new features on our blog as they land in Canary releases.</li>

            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3 class="pt-3">How React features are usually developed </h3>
        <p class="lead">Typically, every React feature has gone through the same stages:</p>
        <div class="container">
            <ol type="1">
                <li>
                    We develop an initial version and prefix it with experimental_ or unstable_. The feature is only available in the experimental 
                    release channel. At this point, the feature is expected to change significantly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    We find a team at Meta willing to help us test this feature and provide feedback on it. This leads to a round of changes. 
                    As the feature becomes more stable, we work with more teams at Meta to try it out.
                </li>
                <li>Eventually, we feel confident in the design. We remove the prefix from the API name, and make the feature available on the main branch by default, 
                    which most Meta products use. At this point, any team at Meta can use this feature.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <h3>Can we just do more minor releases? </h3>
        <p class="lead">Generally, we do use minor releases for introducing new features.</p>
        <p class="lead">However, this isn’t always possible. Sometimes, new features are interconnected 
            with other new features which have not yet been fully completed and that we’re still actively 
            iterating on. We can’t release them separately because their implementations are related. 
            We can’t version them separately because they affect the same packages (for example, react and react-dom). 
            And we need to keep the ability to iterate on the pieces that aren’t 
            ready without a flurry of major version releases, which semver would require us to do.</p>
        <p class="lead">At Meta, we’ve solved this problem by building React from the main branch, and 
            manually updating it to a specific pinned commit every week. This is also the approach that React
             Native releases have been following for the last several years. Every stable release of React Native 
             is pinned to a specific commit from the main branch of the React repository. This lets React Native 
             include important bugfixes and incrementally adopt new React 
            features at the framework level without getting coupled to the global React release schedule.</p>
