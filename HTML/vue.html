            In addition to these tools, it is also important to be comfortable with the Composition 
            API and Options API versions of creating single file Vue components. The Composition API 
            allows developers to organize their code in a more logically organized and reusable and way. 
            The Options API is the classic way of creating Vue components, which uses a set of options to define the componentâ€™s behavior

          <h3>A brief history of Vue Script Setup</h3>
            <p class="lead">One of the things that makes Vue such a versatile framework is 
              that it has evolved to include several ways to write and structure components as the framework 
              itself has grown and matured. Currently, there are three different ways to compose our components: 
              the Options API, the Composition API, 
              and the newest version of the Composition API: Script Setup.</p>
            <p class="lead">Refined by Vue Creator Evan You, the Script Setup is the recommended way to 
              compose components that can scale. It gives Vue developers the freedom to create performant 
              components with built-in readability, reusability, maintainability, 
              modularity, and even makes them more TypeScript-FriendlyTypeScript-Friendly.</p>
