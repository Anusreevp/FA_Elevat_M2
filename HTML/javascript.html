            It might be hyperbole to say that JavaScript is a developer’s 
            best (digital) friend — but it would certainly be hard to get by without it.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            According to a recent survey conducted by Stack Overflow, JavaScript is the world’s 
            most popular programming language, with an incredible 69.7 percent of the 90,000 developers 
            polled citing it as the most-used skill in their programming toolbox. It’s a staple skill for 
            all manner of developers, 
            from the most entry-level junior developers to the highest-ranked programming specialists.

            The chances of a developer not needing to learn or use JavaScript at some point in their careers are slim to none; even if a job doesn’t require its day-to-day use, 
            applicants still typically need to prove their command over it in the interview stage.

          <p class="lead">
            A recent report published by DevSkiller found that not only does the language top the list of the skills developers are tested on during the job search, but that “most developers will get a JavaScript IT skills assessment, regardless of their main focus.” More to the point, 
            a full 72 percent of companies who need developers hire professionals who are proficient in JavaScript.

          <h2 class="p-4">What is JavaScript, and Why Should You Learn It?</h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Let’s break this down. JavaScript is typically used as a client-side scripting language for front 
            end development. In simple terms, this means that developers use JavaScript to build the part of a
             website that ordinary visitors can see and interact with, also known as the “front end.” While the 
             programming language can 
            technically be used to create complex programs, its primary application lies in web development.
